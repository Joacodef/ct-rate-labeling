  You are an expert radiologist. Your task is to extract the presence of specific abnormalities from a radiology report.
  
  Instructions:
  1. Read the provided radiology report carefully.
  2. For each abnormality in the requested list, determine if it is present (1) or absent (0).
  3. Treat negation (e.g., "no evidence of...") as absent (0).
  4. Treat uncertainty (e.g., "suggestive of...", "cannot exclude...") as present (1).
  5. If an abnormality is not mentioned, assume it is absent (0).
  6. Return the result ONLY as a valid JSON object where keys are the abnormality names and values are 0 or 1. Do not include any markdown formatting or explanation.

      Trachea, both main bronchi are open. Mediastinal main vascular structures, heart contour, size are normal. Thoracic aorta diameter is normal. Pericardial effusion-thickening was not observed. Thoracic esophageal calibration was normal and no significant tumoral wall thickening was detected. The right breast is operated. No enlarged lymph nodes in prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal or bilateral hilar-axillary pathological dimensions were detected. When examined in the lung parenchyma window; Fibrotic changes are observed at the right apical level. Aeration of both lung parenchyma is normal and no nodular or infiltrative lesion is detected in the lung parenchyma. Pleural effusion-thickening was not detected. Upper abdominal organs, including sections, are normal. No space-occupying lesion was detected in the liver that entered the cross-sectional area. Bilateral adrenal glands were normal and no space-occupying lesion was detected. Bone structures in the study area are natural. Vertebral corpus heights are preserved. " Thoracic CT examination within normal limits

      The examination was evaluated by comparing it with thorax CT images dated 22/08/2016. Trachea, both main bronchi are open. Heart size, contour, configuration are natural. Pericardial - pleural effusion - thickness increase was not observed. Mediastinal main vascular structures are natural. Millimetric lymph nodes with a short axis diameter not exceeding 1 cm were observed in the paratracheal and aorticopulmonary windows in the mediastinum. Mediastinal and both hilar lymph nodes were not detected in pathological size and appearance. Abdominal solid organs are normal in sections passing through the upper abdomen. No space-occupying lesion was observed in both adrenal sites. When examined in the lung parenchyma window; Nodules with a diameter of 8 mm in ground glass density in the left lung upper lobe anterior, 3 mm superposed to the major fissure in the left lung lower lobe superior and 4 mm in the left lobe lingular segment inferior were observed. No significant difference was found in the size and number of nodules. No newly developing nodule was observed. Active infiltrating area - infiltrative mass lesion was not observed in both lung parenchyma. Bronchial structures in both lungs are slightly ectatic. The medullary densities of the bone structures within the sections are normal. Minimal osteophytic degenerative changes were observed in the vertebral corpus corners. No lytic - destructive lesion was observed. " Stable nodules in the left lung " Minimal bronchiectasis in both lungs
    output: {"Arterial wall calcification": 0, "Lymphadenopathy": 1, "Lung nodule": 1, "Lung opacity": 0, "Pulmonary fibrotic sequela": 0}

      Trachea, both main bronchi are open. Mediastinal main vascular structures, heart contour, size are normal. Pericardial effusion-thickening was not observed. There are calcific atheroma plaques and stents in the aortic arch and coronary arteries. Thoracic esophagus calibration was normal and no significant pathological wall thickening was detected. There are small lymph nodes with a short axis measuring up to 5 mm in the mediastinum. When examined in the lung parenchyma window; In the right hilar region, its extension to the middle lobe is observed, its dimensions are 99x60 in axial sections, its contours are up to 38 mm in craniocaudal sections, its contours are spiculated, the right lower lobe surrounds the main bronchial structure all around, obstructs the right middle lobe bronchus, and slightly patchy crazy paving pattern frosted glass densities are observed around it. There is a space-occupying lesion. Clinical laboratory correlation, close follow-up and histopathological examination are recommended. Apart from this described mass lesion, one or two nodules measuring up to 4 mm are observed in both lungs. There are emphysematous changes, more prominent in the upper lobe apical segments, in both lungs. In the upper abdominal organs included in the sections, there is a 30x23 mm lesion in this localization with suboptimal evaluation without contrast in the right adrenal gland examination. Close follow-up is recommended for the differential diagnosis of metastasis secondary to a highly suspicious finding in favor of the mass lesion described in the right lung. Bone structures in the study area are natural. Vertebral corpus heights are preserved. • Large mass lesion in the right hilar region, extending to the right lung middle lobe and lower lobe, surrounding the right main bronchial structure, obstructing the middle and lower lobe bronchi, clinical laboratory correlation, follow-up, and histopathological examination are recommended. • Except for this described lesion, one or two millimetric nodules in both lungs • Emphysematous changes in both lungs • Calcific atheroma plaques in the arcus aorta and coronary arteries, stents • Right adrenal gland lesion evaluated as suboptimal in daily non-contrast examination, cause of mass lesion described in the right lung Close follow-up is recommended in terms of differential diagnosis of metastases and metastases.
